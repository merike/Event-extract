# LOCALIZATION NOTE:
# you don't have to fill all from.*, until.*, *.prefix and *.suffix patterns
# it's ok to leave some empty

# LOCALIZATION NOTE:
# patterns are partially space-insensitive
# "deadline is" pattern will find both "deadlineis" and "deadline  is"
# but "deadlineis" won't find "deadline is" or "deadline  is"
# therefore you should include all spaces that are valid within a pattern

# LOCALIZATION NOTE:
# there are two different ways to find a start time:
# 1) it matches a from.* pattern and doesn't have end.prefix or end.suffix next to it
# 2) it matches until.* pattern and has start.prefix or start.suffix next to it
# similar inverse logic applies to end times

# can be a list of values, separate variants by |

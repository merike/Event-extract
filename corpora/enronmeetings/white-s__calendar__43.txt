All,

If you do not have time for lunch, please join us up on the trading desk at 11:10 to grab Tree Beards.  We can take a 10 min break from the meeting.

Note:  We moved to room 2557 since it has a white board that can be copied.  

Thank you. 

Debra


This meeting is a result of our EES Wholesale Systems integration meeting last week Friday.  Enclosed is our plan drafted by Accenture for the week.  The goal is to document all EES and Wholesale processes this week.  

Thanks for your support.  

Debra
